Basic git commands:
mkdir - used to create a new directory
git init - to initialise a git repository
git add . - adds all the files in the directory to the respository and stores them in untracked changes
git commit -m "" - used to commit the changes (basically converts the untracked to tracked changes)
git restore --staged filename - used to convert the staged changes into unstaged
git reset hashname - moves all the commits after the hashname to unstaged area
git stash - used to move all the changes to the backstage without losing them
git stash pop - used to bring all the changes from the backstage
git stash clear - used to clear all the changes in the backstage
git add remote origin URL - 
git remote -v
git push origin master - pushes the directory into the master branch
git remote rm origin - removes the existing origin
The main branch should only consist of the finalised code
git branch name - used to create a new branch
Once a new branch is created, the head will be pointing towards the new branch name
